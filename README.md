## :warning: **Deprecation Notice**

We regret to inform you that the Paystack Prestashop 1.6 Plugin is now deprecated and will no longer be actively maintained or supported.

**Reasons for deprecation**:
- Compatibility issues with the latest software versions
- Security vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed sufficiently.
- Obsolete functionality that is no longer relevant

To ensure a seamless experience, we recommend exploring the Paystack Integrations Directory for [alternative plugins](https://paystack.com/gh/integrations?category=cart&id=prestashop) that are actively maintained and supported.


## Installation 

- Download this repository as a zip folder.
- Unzip (decompress) the module archive file (.zip). This should result in a new folder.
- **IMPORTANT!!** Rename the folder to `prestapaystack`.
- Using your FTP client, place the `prestapaystack` folder in your PrestaShop `/modules` folder. Upload the whole folder, not just the files it contains.
- Go to your back-office, in the "Modules" tab.
- Locate the `Paystack` module in the modules list. You might have to scroll down; you can also use the list's search engine, which should give you a dynamically updated list of matching module names.
- Click the "Install" button.
- Your module is now installed and should be activated too (green tick).
- Configure the plugin by copying your keys from [https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer](https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer). Toggle `Live` or `Test` mode as required.
- Make sales!
